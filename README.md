# Apple.finance features a staking and Farming project on Binance Smart Chain. 
With the native Apple.finance platform currency - APP, investors/users can:

##MODEL
* - Exchange BNB/WBNB (Wrapped Binance Coin) for paired Binance smart chain - compatible token (s) and earn APP token as reward for staking. 
* - Farm Binance smart chain tokens by staking APP token. 
* - Earn reward for participating in social and Apple.finance community engagement. 
* - Stake APP to earn more APP Token. 
Using a reducing-balance method, an artificial scarcity is created which thus causes a resultant increase in the price of APP since 
less supply will be in circulation and promote a consequential increase in the token price. 

We are a decentralized trading/finance protocol that runs on the BSC blockchain where investors can:
* - Stake
